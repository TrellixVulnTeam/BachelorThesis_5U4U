## Team Formation Tool, developed by Eva Yiwei Wu & Kiram Ben Aleya

This is the first iteration prototype of our algorithmic team formation tool. Our goal is to enable algorithmic team formartion in educational environments.
We are following both participatory and value sensitive design approaches, focussing on our main stakeholders, the students. 

You may ask yourself why we are using an automated tool to form groups? Automated group formation ensures that everyone finds a group without stress, 
no matter how long they have been at the university. We can ensure that diverse skill sets and subject expertise are present in each group. Further, you
have the option to get to meet new people as well as teaming up with a best friend by selecting eachother in the tool.

This tool considers basic personal information and personal preferences to match\nyou with your dream team. These group matching criteria are determined 
based on\nthe suggestions from your fellow students who took this class last year. The top\nmatching criteria they indicated are:
    1. Gender
    2. Preferred Teammate
    3. Age
    4. Educational Level
    5. Schedule
    6. Skill-set
    7. Major/Minor
    8. Experience: first/second attempt of the module
