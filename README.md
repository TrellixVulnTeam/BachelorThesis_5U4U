## Team Formation Tool, developed by Eva Yiwei Wu & Kiram Ben Aleya

This is the first iteration prototype of our algorithmic team formation tool. Our goal is to enable algorithmic team<br />
formartion in educational environments. We are following both participatory and value sensitive design approaches,<br /> 
focussing on our main stakeholders, the students.<br /><br /> 

You may ask yourself why we are using an automated tool to form groups? Automated group formation ensures that<br />  
everyone finds a group without stress, no matter how long they have been at the university. We can ensure that<br />  
diverse skill sets and subject expertise are present in each group. Further, you have the option to get to meet<br />  
new people as well as teaming up with a best friend by selecting eachother in the tool.<br /><br />

This tool considers basic personal information and personal preferences to match you with your dream team.<br /> 
These group matching criteria are determined based on the suggestions from students who took this class last year.<br /><br /> 
The top matching criteria they indicated are:
    <br />1. Gender
    <br />2. Preferred Teammate
    <br />3. Age
    <br />4. Educational Level
    <br />5. Schedule
    <br />6. Skill-set
    <br />7. Major/Minor
    <br />8. Experience: first/second attempt of the module
